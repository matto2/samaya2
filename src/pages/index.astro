            Samaya is a wonderful practitioner. I have been receiving treatments
            from her for years, and I always am so thankful to have her in my
            life! Her treatments provide effective relief for my aches and
            pains, and support me through emotional ups and downs. She is a
            gifted herbalist, and always knows just the right thing to help me.
            She is consistently thorough in both understanding what I am hoping
            for with the treatment, and in answering any questions I may have.
            Her style of acupuncture is very gentle and restorative— I am so
            appreciative of her care, and recommend her to everyone!

            I have been seeing Samaya for years, and I truly cannot recommend
            her enough! She has been an absolute game changer in helping me
            manage a variety of physical and mental health concerns, including
            perimenopause symptoms, hormone imbalance, and anxiety. Her
            expertise, care, and nurturing approach make every session an
            incredibly healing experience.

            Samaya takes the time to truly listen and understand what’s going
            on, and I never feel rushed during my appointments. Her bedside
            manner is unmatched—she is compassionate, knowledgeable, and deeply
            intuitive in her practice. Every time I leave a session, I feel
            balanced, rejuvenated, and grateful for her care.

            I’ve referred many people to Samaya, and every single one has had an
            equally positive experience. If you are looking for an acupuncturist
            who is not only excellent at what she does but also genuinely cares
            about your well-being, look no further. She is a gem!
